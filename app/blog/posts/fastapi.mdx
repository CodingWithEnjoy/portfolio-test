FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs in Python. It leverages Python's type hints to provide a robust, fast, and developer-friendly experience. With features like automatic data validation, interactive documentation, and high-speed performance, FastAPI has gained immense popularity among developers.

In this blog, we will cover:

- What is FastAPI?
- Why use FastAPI?
- Setting up FastAPI
- Example of a simple FastAPI application
- Key features of FastAPI

## What is FastAPI?

FastAPI is an open-source Python web framework for building APIs. It is based on standard Python type hints and powered by Starlette for the web parts and Pydantic for data validation.

### Highlights of FastAPI:

- **Fast and Asynchronous**: Designed for high-performance, it is built on asynchronous programming capabilities using `async` and `await`.
- **Automatic Validation**: Automatically validates request payloads using Python's type hints and Pydantic.
- **Interactive Documentation**: Generates Swagger UI and ReDoc documentation automatically.
- **Easy-to-use**: Simplifies API development with intuitive syntax.

## Why Use FastAPI?

Here are some reasons to consider FastAPI:

1. **Performance**: Comparable to frameworks like Node.js and Go.
2. **Developer Productivity**: Saves time with auto-generated documentation and easy request validation.
3. **Standards-Based**: Built on OpenAPI and JSON Schema standards.
4. **Scalable**: Suitable for projects of all sizes, from small apps to large-scale APIs.

## Setting Up FastAPI

Getting started with FastAPI is simple. Follow these steps:

1. **Install FastAPI and Uvicorn**:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```

2. **Create a Basic FastAPI App**:

Create a file called `main.py`:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"message": "Welcome to FastAPI!"}

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def read_item(item_id: int, q: str = None):
    return {"item_id": item_id, "query": q}
```

3. **Run the Application**:

Run the application using Uvicorn:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to see the result. You can also access the interactive API documentation at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

## Example of a Simple FastAPI Application

Hereâ€™s an example of a FastAPI application that accepts user data and performs validation:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

class User(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int
    email: str

@app.post("/users/")
def create_user(user: User):
    return {"message": f"User {user.name} created successfully!", "user": user}
```

### Explanation:

- **`BaseModel`**: Defines the data model for request validation.
- **`@app.post`**: Declares a POST endpoint to handle user creation.
- FastAPI automatically validates incoming requests and returns a helpful error if the data is invalid.

Run the above code and test the `/users/` endpoint using tools like Postman or the Swagger UI.

## Key Features of FastAPI

1. **Automatic Documentation**:

FastAPI generates OpenAPI-compliant documentation for your API automatically. Visit `/docs` (Swagger UI) or `/redoc` for interactive API documentation.

2. **Data Validation**:

It validates incoming requests and outgoing responses using Pydantic models. Example:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    price: float
    is_offer: bool = None

@app.put("/items/{item_id}")
def update_item(item_id: int, item: Item):
    return {"item_id": item_id, "item": item}
```

3. **Asynchronous Support**:

FastAPI supports asynchronous programming, making it suitable for I/O-bound tasks:

```python
import asyncio

@app.get("/async")
async def async_endpoint():
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    return {"message": "This endpoint supports async programming!"}
```

4. **Dependency Injection**:

Define dependencies that can be reused across endpoints:

```python
from fastapi import Depends

async def common_dependency():
    return "This is a shared dependency."

@app.get("/dependency")
async def endpoint_with_dependency(dep=Depends(common_dependency)):
    return {"dependency": dep}
```

## Conclusion

FastAPI is a powerful and versatile framework for building APIs in Python. Its simplicity, speed, and out-of-the-box features make it a great choice for both beginners and experienced developers. With minimal setup, you can create robust, well-documented APIs in no time.

Give FastAPI a try and see how it can simplify your API development process!
